# Elevatorsystem_TOC
1. Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to design and implement an elevator system in a premises that efficiently transports passengers between multiple floors in a building. The elevator is present initially in the ground state and moves up to the maximum floor. The elevator system should incorporate various features and functionalities to ensure safe, reliable, and user-friendly operation. The main aspect of the elevator that are going to incorporate in this design are simulating the entry and exit of multiple people at ground floor and enabling their exit at the chosen floor.

2. Requirements:
- Efficient transportation of passengers between floors
- Ability to handle the entry and exit of multiple passengers at the ground floor
- Ensure safe and reliable operation of the elevator system
- Provide user-friendly features and functionalities
- Support for multiple floors in the building

3. Tools Used:
- Programming language: Python
- Modeling and simulation: Simulation software (e.g., Simpy, Simula)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly

4. Solution:
The solution involves designing and implementing an elevator system using a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) to model the control logic and behavior of the elevator. The PDA will handle the processing of passenger requests, floor selection, door operations, and entry/exit of passengers.


5. Concepts Included:
- Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)
- Pushdown Automata (PDAs)
- Non-Deterministic Pushdown Automata (NPDAs)
- Deterministic Pushdown Automata (DPDAs)
- Simulation and modelling
- Data visualization

6. Results:
a) Context-Free Grammar (CFG):
Terminal Symbols: {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, UP, DOWN, OPEN, CLOSE, ENTRY, EXIT}
Non-Terminal Symbols: {S, F, D, P}
Production Rules:
S → F | D | P
F → UP | OPEN | CLOSE | ENTRY | EXIT | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 9
D → DOWN | OPEN | CLOSE | ENTRY | EXIT | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 9
P → ENTRY | EXIT | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 9

b) Context-Free Language(CFL):
The language generated by the above CFG is the set of all valid elevator system control sequences, including floor selection, door operations, and passenger entry/exit.

Example strings:
1. "Select_Floor(2), Open_Door, Enter, Close_Door, Move_Up, Select_Floor(5), Open_Door, Exit, Close_Door"
2. "Select_Floor(1), Open_Door, Enter, Close_Door, Move_Down, Select_Floor(3), Open_Door, Exit, Close_Door"
3. "Select_Floor(4), Open_Door, Enter, Close_Door, Move_Up, Select_Floor(7), Open_Door, Exit, Close_Door"
4. "Select_Floor(6), Open_Door, Enter, Close_Door, Move_Down, Select_Floor(1), Open_Door, Exit, Close_Door"
5. "Select_Floor(3), Open_Door, Enter, Close_Door, Move_Up, Select_Floor(8), Open_Door, Exit, Close_Door"

c) Deterministic Pushdown Automaton (DPDA):
M = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q0, Z0, F)
Where:
Q = {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6, q7, q8, q9, q10, q11, q12, q13, q14} is the set of states.
Σ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, UP, DOWN, OPEN, CLOSE, ENTRY, EXIT} is the input alphabet.
Γ = {Z0} is the stack alphabet, where Z0 is the initial stack symbol.
δ: Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) × Γ → Q × Γ* is the transition function, defined as:
δ(q0, (0-9), Z0) = (q1, Z0)
δ(q1, ENTRY, Z0) = (q2, Z0)
δ(q2, (UP, OPEN, CLOSE), Z0) = (q3, Z0)
δ(q3, (0-9), Z0) = (q4, Z0)
δ(q4, EXIT, Z0) = (q0, Z0)
δ(q0, (0-9), Z0) = (q5, Z0)
δ(q5, ENTRY, Z0) = (q6, Z0)
δ(q6, (UP, OPEN, CLOSE), Z0) = (q7, Z0)
δ(q7, (0-9), Z0) = (q8, Z0)
δ(q8, EXIT, Z0) = (q0, Z0)
δ(q0, (0-9), Z0) = (q9, Z0)
δ(q9, ENTRY, Z0) = (q10, Z0)
δ(q10, (UP, OPEN, CLOSE), Z0) = (q11, Z0)
δ(q11, (0-9), Z0) = (q12, Z0)
δ(q12, EXIT, Z0) = (q0, Z0)
δ(q0, (0-9), Z0) = (q13, Z0)
δ(q13, ENTRY, Z0) = (q14, Z0)
δ(q14, (UP, OPEN, CLOSE), Z0) = (q0, Z0)
q0 is the initial state, Z0 is the initial stack symbol, and F = {q0} is the set of final (accepting) states.
